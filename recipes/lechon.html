    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Lechon is a national dish in the Philippines - pork leg is roasted in the
      oven very slowly resulting in very moist and tasty meat. It is served all
      year for special occasions. Serve with my recipe for lechon sauce (link in
      footnote).
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 Â½ pounds pork leg with skin</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter at room temperature, or as needed</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Rinse pork; pat dry with paper towels. Rub butter all over the skin.
        Sprinkle salt over the skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place pork leg on a rack in a roasting pan. Pour water into the bottom
        of the pan. Cover pan securely with aluminum foil so that steam will not
        escape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil. Reduce heat to
        320 degrees F (160 degrees C). /li>
      </li>

      <li>
        Continue baking, basting with drippings every 30 minutes, until skin is
        crisp, about 3 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
        center should read 176 degrees F (80 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place pork leg on a serving platter. Slice into bite-sized portions.
      </li>
    </ol>
